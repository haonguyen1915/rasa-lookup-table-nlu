# Lookup Table Speed Test

This directory has code for timing training and evaluation as a function of number
of lookup table elements. 

One may run 

	python time_lookups.py

Several convenience functions are included in `time_train_test.py`.

Models and lookup tables are temporarily stored in the `tmp` directory.
